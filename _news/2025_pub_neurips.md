One paper is accepted to <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS 2025</a>. 
The topic is about Depth Completion using **Novel Event Cameras** which uses our [FusionPortable-V2](https://fusionportable.github.io/dataset/fusionportable_v2) as the benchmark.
Congratulation to [Dr.Zhiqiang Yan](https://yanzq95.github.io/) (NUS Research Fellow)!
