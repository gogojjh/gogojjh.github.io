I am currently the senior research fellow in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>, Department of Computer Science.
I work in the <a href="https://rpl-as-ucl.github.io/">Robot Perception and Learning Lab</a> which is led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cE8_5EsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof.Dimitrios Kanoulas</a>. 
My long-term research aims to develop a mobile robotic system with human-level proficiency in localization, navigation, and decision-making, ultimately facilitating applications such as logistics, inspection, and rescue.


I received my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2021 from <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>.
I was fortunate to collaborate with some excellent researchers, including 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P5AJTXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Rui Fan</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RjOPTHIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Lei Tai</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FxARbSYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Haoyang Ye</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=alRGtgwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Peng Yun</a>, and
<a href='https://zarathustr.github.io/'>Prof.Jin Wu</a>.
I was the research associate in the Intelligent and Autonomous Driving Center (IADC) from 2022 to 2023.

More details regarding my previous/ongoing projects can be found on <a href="projects">Research Projects</a>.
