I am currently the senior research fellow in University College London (UCL), Department of Computer Science.
I work in the <a href="rpl-as-ucl.github.io">Robot Perception and Learning Lab</a> which is led by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cE8_5EsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof.Dimitrios Kanoulas</a>, cutting-edge research covering topics ranging from perception, SLAM, and navigation on mobile robots.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2021 from <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>.
I was fortunate to collaborate with some excellent researchers, including 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P5AJTXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Rui Fan</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RjOPTHIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Lei Tai</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FxARbSYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Haoyang Ye</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=alRGtgwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Peng Yun</a>, and
<a href='https://zarathustr.github.io/'>Mr.Jin Wu</a>.
I was the research associate in the Intelligent and Autonomous Driving Center (IADC) from 2022 to 2023.
