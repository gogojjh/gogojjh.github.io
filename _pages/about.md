I am currently the senior research fellow in <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>, Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering.
I am working closed to <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-wen-weisong/">Prof.Welson Wen</a> in the <a href="https://polyu-taslab.github.io/">Trustworthy AI and Autonomous Systems Lab</a>.

My research in autonomous navigation and embodied intelligence includes notable contributions such as [M-LOAM](https://github.com/gogojjh/M-LOAM), [FusionPortable](https://fusionportable.github.io/dataset/fusionportable_v2/), and the scalable, structure-free visual navigation system, [OpenNavMap](https://rpl-cs-ucl.github.io/OpenNavMap_page/).
My long-term research aims to develop lifelong, cognitive spatial memory mechanisms for autonomous systems.
This work centers on achieving sustainable autonomy and dynamic map maintenance capable of scaling to rapidly increasing spatio-temporal requirements in the most challenging, dynamic, and unstructured worlds. This foundational capability is critical for applications, including logistics, infrastructure inspection, and high-stakes rescue missions in domains such as mines and forests.

I received my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2021 from <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>.
I was fortunate to collaborate with some excellent researchers including 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P5AJTXcAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Rui Fan</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RjOPTHIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Lei Tai</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FxARbSYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Haoyang Ye</a>, 
<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=alRGtgwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr.Peng Yun</a>, and
<a href='https://zarathustr.github.io/'>Prof.Jin Wu</a>.
I was the research associate in the Intelligent and Autonomous Driving Center (IADC) from 2022 to 2023, and
senior research in University College London (UCL) from 2024 to 2025.
